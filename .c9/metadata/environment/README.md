The feature is especially useful on mobile devices.\n\n- **Navbar** - navbar contains the dashboard name, home button, refresh graphs button;\n\n- **Pie chart** - one pie chart (`dc.pieChart`) show players total numer of points scored over carrier. By \"mouse on method\" user will see number of points.\n\n- **Stacked bar chart** - `dc.barChart` presents percentage of carrier that every player spent in teams played over the all time.\n\n- **Line charts** - `dc.lineChart` features presenting total assists, blocks, steals. With \"mouse on method\" on dots, viewer will see stats for player\n\n- **Refresh Graph** - feature that will take you to home page and graph will be refreshed;\n\n- **Footer** - simple footer containing link to the original  dataset and link to the data copyrights.\n\n\n### Features left to implement\n\n- Add arrows at the end of x and y axis for both line charts;\n- A survey where you can vote for your best player;\n\n\n##### Loading Page\nThe Loading Page section features a typewriter  (for large screen only)function featuring Micheal's Jordan famous quote.\nthere is no need for viewer to wait for entire quote to load,you can click on stat button anytime.\nOn mobile and tablet devices this feature is not avilible. \nAfter clicking \"See stats\" button you will be taken strait to the site with graphs.\nSimple easy to navigate and hassleless.\n\nThe backgroung for large screens was uploaded from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) and makes feel you really want to play basketball.\n\n##### Portfolio\nThe Portfolio section features all three players that are given different backgrounds, so later they will be identify with these colors.\n\n The Portfolio section also includes some brief info \n about every player like:\n- Date of birth\n- Titles won by players\n- Team played\n- Total games played\n\nThis section is sort of introduction to the viewers, so they have a picture who's stats are compared on this site.\n\n##### Charts\n\nStrait  after that an actual charts with stats will show, along with a scroll up arrow which will come up\nwhile reaching to end of first charts.This allow viewer quick navigation on the website.\nWhen you scroll  further down you will be able to compare players highest point in the season during entire career,\nand the salary that they were earning during that time.\nAt the very bottom the page you will find three horizontal scrolling charts that show asssits, blocks and steals\ngained in every year. Every player has his own chart in this row.\nMost importantly, under every single chart viewer has \"See comment\" button. It will give you some brief info \nabout every single chart.\nThe very last button is sort of summary, and leave a viewer with an impression  that you can choose your own\nplayer as a winner.\n\n##### Footer\nSmall brief footer with as little info as possible just because  this is not most important for this sort of website.\nThe only features are:\n- copyright\n- Github link to developers respositories\n- lastly the link to the source that data were used for\n\nIn overall enough information to satisfy curiosity without overwhelming the user with all data presented.\n\n\n## Technologies Used\nThis project uses HTML and CSS programming languages.\n\n- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)\nThe project uses Google fonts to style the website fonts.\n\n - [jQuery]( https://jquery.com/)\nThe project uses jQuery to reference Javascript needed for the button hovering, displaying or hiding items on website.\n\n- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)\n    - The project uses JavaScript to add interactivity to the dashboard and to retrieve certain data from CSV files for graphs and charts.\n\n- [Bootstrap (ver 4.3.1)](https://getbootstrap.com/)\n    - The project uses the Bootstrap 4 grid and components in order to achieve a responsive layout.\n\n- [crossfilter.js (v 1.3.12)](https://square.github.io/crossfilter/)\n    - The project uses the Crossfilter.js library in order to create dimensions and groups from the datasets that could then be used to build charts using DC.js.\n\n- [dc.js (v 2.1.8)](https://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/)\n    - The project uses the DC.js library in order to build graphs and charts from the prebuilt chart types included in the library.\n\n- [d3.js (v 3.5.17)](https://d3js.org/)\n    - The project uses D3.js order to style the prebuilt charts included in DC.js\n\n- [queue.js (v 1.0.7)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/queue)\n    - The project uses Queue.js in order to bind to the external datasets in the Data folder, as well as to defer the rendering of the charts until all of the required datasets are fully imported.\n  \n- [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/)\n\n## Testing\n\nIt was tested continuously  as I developed it, in Firefox Developer and Chrome, \nusing both Firefox and Chromium developer tools, and nearing the conclusion of \nthe project also on other physical devices.Also, before deployment i checked also in\nOpera and Safari. The only issue that i have noticed is the scroll down arrow that renders as \ncompletely not edited square cube, and on every other device  looks like my concept arrow.\nI used responsive mode in the dev tools and resizing the viewport to find unwanted \nbehavior  so as to correct it. I also periodically checked the appearance on both mine \nphone and tablet (both Android) in Chrome. \nI continually  tested code in the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)\nin order to get rid of errors. \n\nTesting my CSS in the [Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) revealed few errors that I  identify and fixed. \n\nJava Script error in console that developer could not solve(Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()/NBA_greatest_trio/.loading-page:1 ).\n\nVocabulary and grammar was checked on [Spell checker](http://www.reverso.net/spell-checker/english-spelling-grammar/)\n\n- [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/#) - Online tool was used to display the project on various devices;\n\n## Deployment\n\nThis project was developed using the AWS Cloud9 IDE, committed to git and pushed to GitHub using the built in function within AWS.\n\nTo deploy this page to GitHub Pages from its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tomciosegal/NBA_greatest_trio)\n\nI pushed my local git repo of code, images and media to a Github repository, and \nenabled Github Pages for it. There is only one branch, master. URL of Home Page is  [here](https://tomciosegal.github.io/NBA_greatest_trio/) \n\n\n\n### Content\nDatasets were downloaded from the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/xvivancos/michael-jordan-kobe-bryant-and-lebron-james-stats).\n\n\n### Media\nThe photos used in this site were obtained from \n-  [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) \n-  [Unsplashfoto](https://unsplash.com/)\n-  [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/)\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\nI have availed of many resources around the web to help me learn.
