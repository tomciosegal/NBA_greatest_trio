{"changed":true,"filter":false,"title":"README.md","tooltip":"/README.md","value":"# NBA Greatest Trio Interactive Data Dashboard\n\n### Stream Two Project: Interactive Frontend Development - Code Institute\n\nWeb site features a seven charts plus three players portfolio on top of the page where you can\nget familiar with the NBA heroes that developer wanted to present.\nFirstly you will see landing page\nwhere css typewriter starts and you will see one the most famous Micheal Jordan quotes.\nThe See stats button will take you down to actual charts, where all the fun begins.\n[Wireframes](https://github.com/tomciosegal/NBA_greatest_trio/tree/master/wireframes) \nfor the dashboard can be found in the assets folder of the repository.\nA live desktop demo can be found [here](https://tomciosegal.github.io/NBA_greatest_trio/).\n\n\nThe goal was to:\n- attract NBA fans with charts that with show  clear overlook of the most important stats\n- help all viewers compare  those three magnificent players  \n- attract more fans and make them interested in history of NBA\n- introduce this three amazing NBA starts to public\n\n## UX\nType of targeted viewer\n\nTargeted Viewer is:\n- Age from 12\n- Loves NBA games.\n- Especially for fans of those three players, but also for new viewer.\n- Viewer likes to compare  data.\n- Easy to introduce to new viewers.\n\n###### Visitors to this website are searching for:\n- basic data related to our players\n- simplicity and clarity of the charts\n- clearly displayed data\n\nThis website is the best way to help them achieve these things because:\n\n- most of this kind of website present overloaded charts with data\n- other websites give to much  info on one website so the viewer is overwhelmed\n\nThis website is:\n- very easy and quick to navigate.\n- steps the visitor through easy to find and clear information\n- very clear, straightforward  content \"home\" button \"see stats\" button\n- easy guidance  thru the website\n- every player has assigned  color in the portfolio that will represent him thruout the website.\n  that gives a viewer an great UX experience and makes the charts more clear to read and analise.\n- go to the top button gives also simplicity to navigate\n- refresh button availble all the time so you can refresh the charts\n\nVisitors looking to:\n\n-As a new visitor to the website, I want to easily navigate the site,where I can find all info efficiently.\n-As an interested visitor, I want an easy find a stats and be able to compare them all.\n-As a new visitor to the website, I want to learn more about the players(Portfolio).\n-As a potential new NBA fan, I want website to be clear, easy to navigate and all data easy to read and analyze or compare.\n\nMy goal in this design was to create a dashboard that would make a maximum use of the analysed dataset plus striving for a minimalist design.\nThe project aim was to create a dashboard with a simple, modern feel by implementing tile design where each charts is placed in a separate tile.\nVery important was to create a color for each player so they can be identify by color later on.\n\n## User Stories\n\nThe following user stories were used to design this data dashboard:\n\n**User Story 1:** As an NBA fan, I would like to gain an easy to analise data sets and have simple way to compare.\n\n**User Story 2:** As a potential fan ,I would like to understand the difference in data between the players. \n\n**User Story 3:**  As a new visitor I want to understand phenomenon of the players achivements.\n\n### Mockups & Wireframes\n\nThe following wireframe sketches were created to design the dashboard layout options:\n\n- [Mobile display](https://github.com/tomciosegal/NBA_greatest_trio/blob/master/wireframes/mobile.jpg)\n   \n- [Medium display](https://github.com/tomciosegal/NBA_greatest_trio/blob/master/wireframes/tablet.jpg)\n\n- [Desktop display 1](https://github.com/tomciosegal/NBA_greatest_trio/blob/master/wireframes/Lg%20screen1.jpg)\n- [Desktop display 2](https://github.com/tomciosegal/NBA_greatest_trio/blob/master/wireframes/Lg%20screen%202.jpg)\n- [Loading Page](https://github.com/tomciosegal/NBA_greatest_trio/blob/master/wireframes/Landing%20page.jpg)\n\n\n### Existing Features\n\nThe dashboard consists of the following features:\n\n- **Back to top button** - back to top button was implemented so user can go back to the top of the page without scrolling back. The feature is especially useful on mobile devices.\n\n- **Navbar** - navbar contains the dashboard name, home button, refresh graphs button;\n\n- **Pie chart** - one pie chart (`dc.pieChart`) show players total numer of points scored over carrier. By \"mouse on method\" user will see number of points.\n\n- **Stacked bar chart** - `dc.barChart` presents percentage of carrier that every player spent in teams played over the all time.\n\n- **Line charts** - `dc.lineChart` features presenting total assists, blocks, steals. With \"mouse on method\" on dots, viewer will see stats for player\n\n- **Refresh Graph** - feature that will take you to home page and graph will be refreshed;\n\n- **Footer** - simple footer containing link to the original  dataset and link to the data copyrights.\n\n\n### Features left to implement\n\n- Add arrows at the end of x and y axis for both line charts;\n- A survey where you can vote for your best player;\n\n\n##### Loading Page\nThe Loading Page section features a typewriter  (for large screen only)function featuring Micheal's Jordan famous quote.\nthere is no need for viewer to wait for entire quote to load,you can click on stat button anytime.\nOn mobile and tablet devices this feature is not avilible. \nAfter clicking \"See stats\" button you will be taken strait to the site with graphs.\nSimple easy to navigate and hassleless.\n\nThe backgroung for large screens was uploaded from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) and makes feel you really want to play basketball.\n\n##### Portfolio\nThe Portfolio section features all three players that are given different backgrounds, so later they will be identify with these colors.\n\n The Portfolio section also includes some brief info \n about every player like:\n- Date of birth\n- Titles won by players\n- Team played\n- Total games played\n\nThis section is sort of introduction to the viewers, so they have a picture who's stats are compared on this site.\n\n##### Charts\n\nStrait  after that an actual charts with stats will show, along with a scroll up arrow which will come up\nwhile reaching to end of first charts.This allow viewer quick navigation on the website.\nWhen you scroll  further down you will be able to compare players highest point in the season during entire career,\nand the salary that they were earning during that time.\nAt the very bottom the page you will find three horizontal scrolling charts that show asssits, blocks and steals\ngained in every year. Every player has his own chart in this row.\nMost importantly, under every single chart viewer has \"See comment\" button. It will give you some brief info \nabout every single chart.\nThe very last button is sort of summary, and leave a viewer with an impression  that you can choose your own\nplayer as a winner.\n\n##### Footer\nSmall brief footer with as little info as possible just because  this is not most important for this sort of website.\nThe only features are:\n- copyright\n- Github link to developers respositories\n- lastly the link to the source that data were used for\n\nIn overall enough information to satisfy curiosity without overwhelming the user with all data presented.\n\n\n## Technologies Used\nThis project uses HTML and CSS programming languages.\n\n- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)\nThe project uses Google fonts to style the website fonts.\n\n - [jQuery]( https://jquery.com/)\nThe project uses jQuery to reference Javascript needed for the button hovering, displaying or hiding items on website.\n\n- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)\n    - The project uses JavaScript to add interactivity to the dashboard and to retrieve certain data from CSV files for graphs and charts.\n\n- [Bootstrap (ver 4.3.1)](https://getbootstrap.com/)\n    - The project uses the Bootstrap 4 grid and components in order to achieve a responsive layout.\n\n- [crossfilter.js (v 1.3.12)](https://square.github.io/crossfilter/)\n    - The project uses the Crossfilter.js library in order to create dimensions and groups from the datasets that could then be used to build charts using DC.js.\n\n- [dc.js (v 2.1.8)](https://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/)\n    - The project uses the DC.js library in order to build graphs and charts from the prebuilt chart types included in the library.\n\n- [d3.js (v 3.5.17)](https://d3js.org/)\n    - The project uses D3.js order to style the prebuilt charts included in DC.js\n\n- [queue.js (v 1.0.7)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/queue)\n    - The project uses Queue.js in order to bind to the external datasets in the Data folder, as well as to defer the rendering of the charts until all of the required datasets are fully imported.\n  \n\n\n## Testing\n\nIt was tested continuously  as I developed it, in Firefox Developer and Chrome, \nusing both Firefox and Chromium developer tools, and nearing the conclusion of \nthe project also on other physical devices.Also, before deployment i checked also in\nOpera and Safari. The only issue that i have noticed is the scroll down arrow that renders as \ncompletely not edited square cube, and on every other device  looks like my concept arrow.\nI used responsive mode in the dev tools and resizing the viewport to find unwanted \nbehavior  so as to correct it. I also periodically checked the appearance on both mine \nphone and tablet (both Android) in Chrome. \nI continually  tested code in the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)\nin order to get rid of errors. \n\nTesting my CSS in the [Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) revealed few errors that I  identify and fixed. \n\nJava Script error in console that developer could not solve(Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()/NBA_greatest_trio/.loading-page:1 ).\n\nVocabulary and grammar was checked on [Spell checker](http://www.reverso.net/spell-checker/english-spelling-grammar/)\n\n- [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/#) - Online tool was used to display the project on various devices;\n\n## Deployment\n\nThis project was developed using the AWS Cloud9 IDE, committed to git and pushed to GitHub using the built in function within AWS.\n\nTo deploy this page to GitHub Pages from its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tomciosegal/NBA_greatest_trio)\n\nI pushed my local git repo of code, images and media to a Github repository, and \nenabled Github Pages for it. There is only one branch, master. URL of Home Page is  [here](https://tomciosegal.github.io/NBA_greatest_trio/) \n\n\n\n### Content\nDatasets were downloaded from the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/xvivancos/michael-jordan-kobe-bryant-and-lebron-james-stats).\n\n\n### Media\nThe photos used in this site were obtained from \n-  [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) \n-  [Unsplashfoto](https://unsplash.com/)\n-  [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/)\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\nI have availed of many resources around the web to help me learn. The following is \nfar from a complete list, but it covers those which were most important for me.\n\n- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/5656369/john)\n- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)\n- [CSS_TRICKS](https://css-tricks.com/)\n- The code-institute-room at [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-ie/)\n- [Codedrops](https://tympanus.net/codrops/)\n- [Awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/)\n- [Codepen](https://codepen.io/)\n\nMany thanks to **Simen Daehlin** mentor at Code Institute for useful comments, sugestions and help on my project.\n\nThe project was published on Code Institute Slack code-peer-review channel where other students and mentors tested \nthe site, reviewed the code and provided a useful feedback that was then implemented.\n\nMany thanks to **Sean Murphy** probably Code Institute best Java Script expert,for useful comments, sugestions and help on writting codes for charts.\n\n\nI decided for that project for my own curiosity as an NBA fan, as all other websites were really overloaded with data.
